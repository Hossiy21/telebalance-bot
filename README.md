# telebalance-bo

A small Go Telegram bot that tracks or reports balances (project name: `telebalance-bo`).

This repository contains a minimal Go bot. The entry point is `main.go`.

## Requirements

- Go 1.20+ (or recent stable Go)
- A Telegram bot token (from BotFather)
- (Optional) Git for version control

## Configuration

The bot reads configuration from environment variables. Set the following before running:

- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` — your Telegram bot token provided by BotFather

Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:TELEGRAM_TOKEN = "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
```

If your `main.go` expects other env vars or flags, add them here.

## Build

From the repository root (`e:/All Files/Project/tele/telebot`):

```powershell
# Build the binary
go build -o telebalance .
```

## Run

```powershell
# Ensure TELEGRAM_TOKEN is set in the environment (see above)
.\\telebalance.exe
```

Or run without building:

```powershell
go run .
```

## Development notes

- The entry point is `main.go` — open it to see the bot's behavior and any additional env vars or config it expects.
- Consider adding a `.env` file and a small helper to load it during development (for example, use `github.com/joho/godotenv`).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your feature/fix
3. Open a pull request with a clear description

## License

Add a LICENSE file or update this section to reflect your desired license.

## Troubleshooting

- If `go build` fails, verify your Go version (`go version`) and that `GOPATH`/module settings are correct.
- If the bot doesn't respond, check that the `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` is valid and that the bot is not blocked by Telegram.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Detect required env vars by scanning `main.go` and update the README accordingly.
- Add a minimal `.env.example` and a `Makefile`/PowerShell script for common dev tasks.
